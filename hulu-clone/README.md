# Hulu Clone

### By Anurag Sharan

This is a clone of the Hulu frontend. I have made this using Next JS which is a SSR framework for React. I have also used Tailwind CSS which provides lots of utility classes for CSS.

I made this project to learn Next JS and Tailwind CSS so if you find any errors or improvements, feel free to raise an issue or send a pull request. I will definitely merge it after reviewing it. 

Thank you for checking out my project, you can find the steps to start and build the app in the following text.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

# Example

The website is deployed on Vercel here: [https://hulu-clone-blue-delta.vercel.app/](https://hulu-clone-blue-delta.vercel.app/).
